# PS2PSP

These are PCB design and arduino software files for a circuit board that converts a PS2 controller into signals a PSP2000 motherboard can understand. The circuit board is designed to have the PSP power cable routed through it, so you can boot up the PSP and the adapter with a basic toggle switch.
